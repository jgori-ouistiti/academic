      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a researcher in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), mainly focused on how we can exploit computational models of human behavior to build better intelligent interfaces, with a particular interest in motor control. I have developed various models of performance for goal-directed movements, mainly based on Shannon’s information theory, and have investigated several statistical questions related to the evaluation of pointing movements. I am also interested in designing better software, usually by exploiting models of human behavior.
